# Arknos Technologies Website - Export Guide

## Quick Netlify Deployment

Your project is now fully configured for Netlify deployment! Here's what's ready:

### ✅ Files Configured:
- `netlify.toml` - Netlify build configuration
- `README.md` - Complete project documentation  
- `DEPLOYMENT.md` - Detailed deployment instructions
- `.gitignore` - Clean file exclusions for export

### 🚀 Deploy to Netlify (3 Steps):

1. **Push to Git Repository**
   - Create a new repository on GitHub/GitLab
   - Push all project files to the repository

2. **Connect to Netlify**
   - Go to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com)
   - Click "New site from Git"
   - Connect your repository

3. **Deploy**
   - Netlify will auto-detect settings from `netlify.toml`
   - Build command: `vite build`
   - Publish directory: `dist/public`
   - Your site will be live in minutes!

### 📁 Build Verification:

The build process has been tested and works perfectly:
```
✓ 1778 modules transformed
✓ Assets optimized (logos, CSS, JS)
✓ Static files ready in dist/public/
```

### 🌐 What Works Out of the Box:
- ✅ Professional landing page
- ✅ Responsive design with animated backgrounds
- ✅ High-quality logos (header & footer)
- ✅ Contact form UI (static version)
- ✅ SEO optimized
- ✅ Fast loading with optimized assets

### 📧 Contact Form Note:
- The contact form displays but won't send emails in static deployment
- For email functionality, see `DEPLOYMENT.md` for backend setup options
- Alternative: The form can be easily connected to services like Formspree or Netlify Forms
